<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![VTuber Debut Screen Shot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/736004592139108455/1082459969825292368/Screenshot_2023-03-06_at_7.19.00_PM.png)

Inspired by "Choose Your Own Adventure" games, VTuber Debut follows our protagonist as they prepare to become a VTuber. In the game, the player has 5 days until their debut, and must decide what activities to work on each day in order to make their debut a success, starting with creating a Vtuber persona/character. Your choices each day affect the outcome of your debut. 

This game is short (*less than 15 mins gametime*), sweet, and wholesome with 3 endings and one *"secret"* ending. Can you get them all?

What kind of VTuber will you make? And what kind of debut will you have? Play and find out!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
